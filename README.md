# ToDoReactNativeApp

A simple and intuitive To-Do application built with **React Native** using **Snack**. This app allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed. It serves as a great starter project for learning how to build mobile applications with React Native.

## Features

- **Add tasks**: Users can easily add new tasks to their to-do list.
- **Delete tasks**: Users can remove tasks that are no longer needed.
- **Mark tasks as completed**: Users can toggle tasks between completed and pending states.
- **Responsive UI**: The app works smoothly on both Android and iOS devices.


## Technologies Used

- **React Native**: A framework for building mobile apps using JavaScript and React.
- **Snack**: A web-based IDE for building and running React Native apps directly in your browser.
- **AsyncStorage**: For local storage of tasks (to persist data between app restarts).
- **JavaScript/ES6+**: Used for modern JavaScript features and syntax.

## How to Run

You can try the app directly from Snack:
